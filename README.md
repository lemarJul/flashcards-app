## About The Project

The Mnemoniac App is a personal project aimed at deepening my understanding of backend development using Node.js and Express. The application utilizes the concept of flashcards and the Leitner system to help users improve their memory.

Flashcards are a popular and effective tool for memorizing and learning new information. In this application, users can create their own flashcards with a question or prompt on one side and the answer on the other.

The Leitner system is a method of efficiently using flashcards that was proposed by the German science journalist Sebastian Leitner in the 1970s. In this system, correctly answered cards are advanced to the next, less frequently studied box, while incorrectly answered cards return to the first box for more aggressive review and repetition.

By building this application, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of how to structure a backend, handle routes and requests, and work with databases in a Node.js and Express environment.

## Feedback and Advice

As this is a project for learning and improving, I am very open to feedback and advice. If you have any suggestions on how I could improve the code, structure, features, or any aspect of the application, please feel free to open an issue or a pull request. Your input is greatly appreciated!
